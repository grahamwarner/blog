## Project Introduction

I live on Vancouver Island and occasionally travel from Swartz Bay to Tsawwassen via BC Ferries, usually with my car. The ferries on this route run every 1-2 hours and can get full during busy times so you might need to wait a sailing (or more!) if you're unlucky. You can drive to the terminal and purchase a ticket with the hopes that there will be space available, or you can purchase a reservation ($17.00 at time of writing) to reserve your spot. In order to use your reservation, you must arrive at the terminal between 30 and 60 minutes before the scheduled sailing time.

There are 2 situations that I'd like to avoid:
1. Arriving at the ferry terminal just after the ferry becomes full. This is frustrating because you may have to wait 1+ hours for the next ferry, and had you arrived slightly earlier, you might have saved yourself hours of wait time.
2. Paying for a reservation and then finding the ferry empty once you get to the terminal.

Your reservation is void if you show up less than 30 minutes before sailing. It can take several minutes to get through the ticketing lineup, so if you purchase a reservation you would likely aim to arrive at the terminal ~40 minutes before sailing (assuming <10 minutes in the lineup). 

There are two strategies for reducing wait time at the terminal and reservation costs
